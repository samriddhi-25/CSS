    <h1>FLOWERS</h1>
    <p>A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants
        of the division Angiospermae). Flowers produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants consist of a few haploid
        cells which produce gametes. The "male" gametophyte, which produces non-motile sperm, is enclosed within pollen
        grains; the "female" gametophyte is contained within the ovule. When pollen from the anther of a flower is
        deposited on the stigma, this is called pollination. Some flowers may self-pollinate, producing seed using
        pollen from the same flower or a different flower of the same plant, but others have mechanisms to prevent
        self-pollination and rely on cross-pollination, when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the
        stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species.</p>

    <h2>ETYMOLOGY</h2>
    <P> Flower is from the Middle English flour, which referred to both the ground grain and the reproductive structure
        in plants, before splitting off in the 17th century. It comes originally from the Latin name of the Italian
        goddess of flowers, Flora. The early word for flower in English was blossom,[4] though it now refers to flowers
        only of fruit trees.[5]</P>

    <h2>MORPHOLOGY</h2>
    <P>The morphology of a flower, or its form and structure,[6] can be considered in two parts: the vegetative part,
        consisting of non-reproductive structures such as petals; and the reproductive or sexual parts. A stereotypical
        flower is made up of four kinds of structures attached to the tip of a short stalk or axis, called a receptacle.
        Each of these parts or floral organs is arranged in a spiral called a whorl.[7] The four main whorls (starting
        from the base of the flower or lowest node and working upwards) are the calyx, corolla, androecium, and
        gynoecium. Together the calyx and corolla make up the non-reproductive part of the flower called the perianth,
        and in some cases may not be differentiated. If this is the case, then they are described as tepals.[8]</P>

        DEVELOPMENT
    </h2>
    <p>A flower develops on a modified shoot or axis from a determinate apical meristem (determinate meaning the axis
        grows to a set size). It has compressed internodes, bearing structures that in classical plant morphology are
        interpreted as highly modified leaves.[34] Detailed developmental studies, however, have shown that stamens are
        often initiated more or less like modified stems (caulomes) that in some cases may even resemble
        branchlets.[35][16] Taking into account the whole diversity in the development of the androecium of flowering
        plants, we find a continuum between modified leaves (phyllomes), modified stems (caulomes), and modified
        branchlets (shoots).[36][37]</p>
